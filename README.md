## Step 1: Initial Data Exploration

**Objective:** The first step involves loading the raw data from the Excel file, understanding its structure, and identifying potential issues that need to be addressed before analysis.

### Steps:
1. Import the raw Excel file into Python using **Pandas**.
2. Inspect the dataset to understand its columns, data types, and initial observations.
3. Look for missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
4. Document key observations from the raw dataset.

### Code Example:
Hereâ€™s a sample script to load and explore the data:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the raw Excel file
file_path = 'Youseff Trade Analysis Week 2 2025.xlsx'
data = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Get a summary of the dataset
print(data.info())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())
```

### Expected Outcome:
- A clear understanding of the data structure (columns, rows, and types).
- Notes on any cleaning/preprocessing steps required.
